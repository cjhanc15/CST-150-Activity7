# CST-150-Activity7

## Summary:
1. Something I learned was that it is unnecessary to include an if statement for zero, when trying to separate odd and even numbers. This is because it does not fall into either category. It does not necessarily break the code to do this, but it does not need to be done. Because I learned this, I was able to make my code much more efficient.
2. Because I am not the best at math, I did run into a couple challenges. I had a few typos, and I had a lot of unnecessary math going on in my loop at first. Once I realized how simple the equation really is, I was able to get a better grasp on it and clean up my code. By cleaning up my code, it worked much more smoothly, and my code looked better!

## How To Use:
1. Enter a number of terms (must be a positive integer).

2. Click the calculate button.

3. See the solution below!
As you can see from the examples below, the higher the number, the closer it is to PI. The lower the number, the lesser the accuracy.
